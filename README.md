# B8IT107DataVis

Continuous assessment for module B8IT107 Data Visualization & Communications taught by David Gordon as part of the Dublin Business School Higher Diploma in Data Analytics.

Data set from the 2019 Stack Overflow developer survey was used to see how the course so far has prepared students for future data roles. A presentation was prepared which included multiple Tableau dashboards.
